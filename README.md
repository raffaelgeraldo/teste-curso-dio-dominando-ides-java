# README STILL BEING WRITTEN

Based on my java development studies, which it's not completed, then gona have lot's of mistakes... i learned a class called cat and developed a program to run it. Until now it's everything okay.

Althoulght i was learning how to delelop a calculator with a bug to after learn how to debug it. Unfortunately my code have some mistakes and it's not ok to run showing the debug :/

The bug in the calculator was intecionally created in the division code which not show the result 2,5 when we divide 5 by 2 in the code. So, my actually study it's about how to understand te functions to debud a specific line in the code.

### The calculator error appearence
