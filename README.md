# README STILL BEING WRITTEN



Based on my java development studies, which it's not completed, then gona have lot's of mistakes... i learned a class called cat and developed a program to run it. Until now it's everything okay.

Althoulght i was learning how to delelop a calculator with a bug to after learn how to debug it. Unfortunately my code have some mistakes and it's not ok to run showing the debug :/

The bug in the calculator was intecionally created in the division code which not show the result 2,5 when we divide 5 by 2 in the code. So, my actually study it's about how to understand te functions to debud a specific line in the code.

### The calculator error appearence

Now the program it's okay.

A i know english, i read the console and through some intuition i solved the problem about method + int.
A friend of mine called Osvaldo who it's a development student too, helped me about the } in wrong lines.

As you can se, i used the int 5 and int 2 to run my calculator. then the result of de division was 2. it was made propositaly to i learn how to solve a simple "bug", so, i will looking for how the program can return to me the correct answer which is 2,5

I will be back.

Trying to resolute the bug in the division, i understand the funcition int just return me  numbers without decimal places... Then i used the funcition "double" instead "int". The program gave me the decimal place 2,0, but the answer that need is 2,5. 

Look down

Let's see what i'll get...
